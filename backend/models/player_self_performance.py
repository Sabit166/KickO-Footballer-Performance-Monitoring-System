"""Player Self Performance Blueprint

Adds player-centric endpoints:
  1) /player/self/matches?email=...       -> list matches for the player's team(s)
  2) /player/self/performance/<match_id>?email=... -> that player's stats for the chosen match
     (Aggregated with GROUP BY â€“ no window functions.)

Keeps logic simple and parameterized (no hardcoded emails).
