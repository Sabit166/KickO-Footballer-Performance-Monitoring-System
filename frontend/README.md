# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

Hello guys!!!!This is for your help.Follow the steps below to run react app
1.Install node js[https://nodejs.org/en/download]
2.open the terminal and change the directory to frontend
3.type "npm install" in the terminal and npm(Node Package Manager) will automatically install all the dependencies
4.If it gives error despite of the nodejs being detected by the window cmd but not in vscode then try restarting the vs code or simply change the vs code terminal to comaand prompt from the terminal dropdown menu.It will solve the issue
5.For the time being we will not change anything in the public folder expecially index.html.Leave them as they are 
6.All the supporting Js files will be at Components folder
7.I have added bootsrap css and script so we can use the template available at [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/].Feel free to use them.
8.You can find resources here [https://react.dev/learn]
9.I would recommend Code With Harry youtube channel if you want to learn some basics to get started with
10.If anything goes wrong during installation delete all things and start from the beginning
11.I have updated the .gitignore file so you can commit and push without worrying
